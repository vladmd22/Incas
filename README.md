This Skoltech Deep Learning Course 2023 final project " - Ink detection ofHerculaneum scrolls"

The goal is to detecting ink from 3D X-ray scans and reading the contents.
Due to the heat of the volcano, the scrolls were carbonized, and are now impossible to open without breaking them.
We will try to find the best model to get the maximum accuracy.
