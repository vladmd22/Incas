This Skoltech Deep Learning Course 2023 final project " - Ink detection ofHerculaneum scrolls"

## Installation

You can download this repo by simply:

        git clone https://github.com/vladmd22/NeRF_this

The requred packages can be installed from ``requirements.txt``:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

Or by creating custom environment nerf-this by simply running:

        conda create env


``` https://github.com/vladmd22/Incas ```


The goal is to detecting ink from 3D X-ray scans and reading the contents.
Due to the heat of the volcano, the scrolls were carbonized, and are now impossible to open without breaking them.
We will try to find the best model to get the maximum accuracy.
